# Zip Preview

This is a [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app) plugin that allows you to look inside of a zip file without having to download and extract it.

## Usage

With this plugin installed, zip files will have a tab on the bottom that you can click to expand. From there, navigate by clicking the folder names and the return button to go back. Clicking on a file will show a preview of it, with an option to download. Admittedly, this preview is pretty clunky. It can only display (some) images, video, audio and text files. Anything else will have an option to try displaying it as text, but that's it.
