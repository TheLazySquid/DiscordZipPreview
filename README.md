# Zip Preview

This is a [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app) plugin that allows you to look inside of a zip file without having to download and extract it.

## Usage

With this plugin installed, zip files will have a tab on the bottom that you can click to expand. From there, navigate by clicking the folder names and the return button to go back. Clicking on a file will show a preview of it, with an option to download and copy the text, along with automatic syntax highlighting.
